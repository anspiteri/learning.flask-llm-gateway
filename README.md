# learning.flask-llm-gateway
I'm using this learning project to grow my back-end stack skills and additionally experiment with low-cost AI integration. 

I will be creating a middle-ware service that simply handles task management between a generic app and llm. The service is based on this [IBM article](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-gateway).
